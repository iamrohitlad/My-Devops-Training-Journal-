User and Group Management in Linux 
Linux is a multi-user operating system, allowing multiple users to access the system 
simultaneously. User and group management is essential for maintaining system security 
and controlling access to files and resources. 
Users 
Types of Users 
1. Root User: The root user is the superuser with unrestricted access to the system. The 
root user's home directory is /root. 
2. Regular Users: These are non-privileged users created by the root user or system 
administrators. Each regular user has a unique username and a home directory 
located in /home/username. 
Creating Users 
To create a new user, use the useradd command followed by the username: 
sudo useradd john 
After creating a user, set the password using the passwd command: 
sudo passwd john 
User Configuration Files 
• /etc/passwd: Contains user account information. Each line represents a user. 
plaintext 
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe,,,:/home/john:/bin/bash 
 
• /etc/shadow: Contains encrypted user passwords and account expiration 
information. Only readable by the root user. 
john:$6$abcd1234$abcdefghijklmnopqrstu:/home/john:/bin/bash 
• /etc/group: Contains group information. 
developers:x:1002:john

Groups 
Groups allow administrators to manage permissions for multiple users simultaneously. Each 
user can belong to one or more groups. 
Creating Groups 
To create a new group, use the groupadd command: 
sudo groupadd developers 
Adding Users to Groups 
To add a user to a group, use the usermod command: 
sudo usermod -aG developers john
