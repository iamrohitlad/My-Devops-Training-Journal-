Package management in Linux refers to the process of installing, updating, configuring, and

The most common package management systems are: 
1. APT (Advanced Package Tool): Used by Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu. 
2. YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) / DNF (Dandified YUM): Used by Red Hat
based distributions like CentOS and Fedora. 
3. Pacman: Used by Arch Linux. 
4. Zypper: Used by openSUSE.
