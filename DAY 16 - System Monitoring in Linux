System monitoring in Linux involves tracking and analyzing the performance and health of 
the system, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network activity, and running 
processes. Several tools are available in Linux to monitor these aspects, ranging from 
command-line utilities to graphical applications

Key System Monitoring Tools 
1. top 
top provides a real-time, dynamic view of the system’s processes, including CPU and 
memory usage. 
Usage: 
top 
Key Information: 
• PID: Process ID 
• USER: User that owns the process 
• PR: Priority of the process 
• NI: Nice value of the process 
• VIRT: Virtual memory used by the process 
• RES: Resident memory used by the process 
• SHR: Shared memory used by the process 
• S: Process status (R: running, S: sleeping, Z: zombie) 
• %CPU: CPU usage 
• %MEM: Memory usage
 TIME+: Total CPU time used by the process 
• COMMAND: Command name or command line 

2. htop 
htop is an enhanced version of top with a more user-friendly interface and additional 
features. 
Usage: 
htop 
Features: 
• Color-coded display 
• Easy process management (kill processes directly) 
• Detailed system overview 
Installation: 
sudo apt install htop  # For Debian/Ubuntu 
sudo yum install htop  # For CentOS/RHEL

3. vmstat 
vmstat reports information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU 
activity. 
Usage: 
vmstat 1 5   
# Run vmstat with 1-second intervals for 5 iterations
Key Information: 
• procs: Number of processes (r: runnable, b: blocked) 
• memory: Memory usage (swpd: swapped, free: free memory, buff: buffers, cache: 
cache) 
• swap: Swap activity (si: swap in, so: swap out) 
• io: I/O activity (bi: blocks received, bo: blocks sent) 
• system: System statistics (in: interrupts per second, cs: context switches per second) 
• cpu: CPU usage (us: user, sy: system, id: idle, wa: wait)

4. iostat 
iostat reports CPU and I/O statistics. 
Usage: 
iostat -x 1 5   
# Extended statistics with 1-second intervals for 5 iterations 
Key Information: 
• tps: Transactions per second 
• kB_read/s: Kilobytes read per second 
• kB_wrtn/s: Kilobytes written per second 
• await: Average wait time for I/O requests 

5. free 
free displays the amount of free and used memory in the system. 
Usage: 
free -h   
# Display memory usage in human-readable format 
Key Information: 
• total: Total memory 
• used: Used memory 
• free: Free memory 
• shared: Shared memory 
• buff/cache: Buffers/cache 
• available: Available memory

6. df 
df reports the amount of disk space used and available on file systems. 
Usage: 
df -h  # Display disk usage in human-readable format
Key Information: 
• Filesystem: Name of the filesystem 
• Size: Total size of the filesystem 
• Used: Used space 
• Avail: Available space 
• Use%: Percentage of used space 
• Mounted on: Mount point

7. du 
du estimates file space usage. 
Usage: 
du -sh /path/to/directory  # Display summary of disk usage for a directory 
Key Information: 
• Size: Size of the directory or file 
• File/Directory: Name of the file or directory 

8. netstat 
netstat displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade 
connections, and multicast memberships. 
Usage: 
netstat -tuln  # Display all listening TCP and UDP ports 
Key Information: 
• Proto: Protocol (TCP, UDP) 
• Recv-Q: Receive queue size 
• Send-Q: Send queue size 
• Local Address: Local address and port number 
• Foreign Address: Foreign address and port number 
• State: Connection state (LISTEN, ESTABLISHED) 

9. iftop 
iftop displays bandwidth usage on an interface by host. 
Usage: 
sudo iftop -i eth0  # Monitor bandwidth usage on interface eth0 
Features: 
• Real-time bandwidth monitoring 
• Source and destination IP addresses 
• Bandwidth usage per connection 
Installation: 
sudo apt install iftop  # For Debian/Ubuntu 
sudo yum install iftop  # For CentOS/RHEL

10. nmon 
nmon (Nigel's Monitor) is a performance monitoring tool for CPU, memory, disks, network, 
NFS, processes, and resources. 
Usage: 
nmon 
Features: 
• Interactive monitoring 
• Graphical display of various metrics 
• Export data for further analysis
