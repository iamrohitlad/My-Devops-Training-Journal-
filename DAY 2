Core Principles of Devops 
1. Automation
Description: Automation is at the core of DevOps. By automating repetitive tasks, teams can increase efficiency, reduce human error, and ensure consistency. Automation applies to testing, deployment, infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and more.
Example: At Google, developers use automated pipelines for CI/CD to handle code builds, tests, and deployments. Tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD allow teams to automate these processes, freeing developers to focus on writing quality code.

2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
Description: CI/CD focuses on frequently integrating code and automating the delivery pipeline. It allows code to be tested and deployed in smaller, manageable increments, reducing risks and improving release quality.
Example: Amazon uses CI/CD to manage deployments for its global platform. With automated tests and builds, Amazon ensures that every code change is thoroughly vetted and can be deployed with minimal risk.

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Description: IaC enables teams to manage infrastructure using version-controlled code. This approach makes infrastructure deployments repeatable, consistent, and scalable, reducing the risks associated with manual configurations.
Example: Capital One uses IaC to deploy its infrastructure across AWS regions. By defining infrastructure in code (e.g., using AWS CloudFormation), the team can quickly replicate the same environment for testing, development, and production, ensuring consistency across deployments.

4. Microservices Architecture
Description: A microservices architecture breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate over APIs. This modularity enables teams to work on individual components without impacting the entire application, allowing faster and more reliable deployments.
Example: Uber operates its platform using a microservices architecture. Each service, such as ride pricing, mapping, or payment processing, operates independently. If thereâ€™s an issue with the payment service, other services remain unaffected, ensuring minimal disruption.

5. Configuration Management and Version Control
Description: Configuration management helps maintain system configurations across various environments. Version control, on the other hand, tracks changes in code, infrastructure configurations, and pipelines, enabling quick rollbacks and consistency.
Example: Git is a popular version control system used by DevOps teams to manage code and configurations. Using Git for IaC scripts allows teams to track every infrastructure change, facilitating rollback and collaboration.

6. DevSecOps 
Description: DevSecOps integrates security into every phase of the development and operations cycle. It encourages secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, and access controls as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Example: A financial institution uses DevSecOps practices to ensure secure software releases. Security scans, penetration testing, and compliance checks are automated in the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring the application meets regulatory standards before each release.

7. Monitoring, Logging, and Feedback Loops
Description: Monitoring and logging give visibility into application performance and issues. Feedback loops allow teams to analyze metrics and insights, using them to make improvements and optimize performance.
Example: Shopify uses monitoring tools like New Relic and Datadog to track application performance in real-time. Log data from these tools helps identify slowdowns or potential issues, allowing engineers to respond quickly and keep the application stable.

8. Collaboration and Communication
Description: Collaboration is a key principle of DevOps, fostering a culture where developers and operations teams share ownership of the entire lifecycle of applications. Tools that facilitate communication are essential for building and maintaining this culture.
Example: Atlassian promotes a collaborative culture by using tools like Jira for tracking work and Confluence for documenting processes. This allows everyone in the organization to stay informed and work together on shared goals.

2.Walmart:
Uses IaC to manage infrastructure across its global data centers.
Automates deployments to handle large-scale traffic demands.
Uses monitoring tools to gain insights into system performance and proactively address issues.


DEVOPS WORKFLOW 

1.Client Request for New Feature
The client informs the project manager about a new feature that needs to be added to the application.
2.Ticket Creation
The project manager creates a ticket in a project management tool (e.g., Jira) to track the new feature request.
The ticket is then assigned to a developer for implementation.
3.Code Development and Local Testing
The developer writes the code for the new feature and tests it locally to ensure functionality and stability.
4.Code Push to GitHub
Once the developer is satisfied with the local testing, they push the code changes to a GitHub repository.
This triggers the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.

CI/CD Pipeline Stages in Jenkins
1.Tool Installation
Jenkins installs any necessary tools specified in the pipeline configuration. This could include tools for building, testing, and scanning code.
2.Git Checkout
Jenkins checks out the latest code from the GitHub repository, ensuring the pipeline works with the updated code.
3.Code Compilation
The pipeline compiles the code, converting it into an executable format, ready for further testing and packaging.
4.Unit Testing
Jenkins runs unit test cases to validate the individual components of the code. This ensures that any changes made have not broken existing functionality.
5.SonarQube Analysis
The pipeline runs a code quality analysis using SonarQube. This step checks the code for any bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells, ensuring high code quality standards.
6.File System Scan with Trivy
Trivy performs a file system scan on the application code to identify any known vulnerabilities. This step enhances security by detecting potential threats early.
7.Build/Package Application
Jenkins builds or packages the application, preparing it for deployment. This could involve generating a JAR, WAR, or any other executable package format.
8.Publish to Nexus Repository
The built artifacts are published to a Nexus artifact repository. This makes them accessible for future deployment stages or other development environments.
9.Docker Image Build
Jenkins builds a Docker image for the application. This image encapsulates the application and its dependencies, making it portable and ready for containerized environments.
10.Docker Image Scan with Trivy
Trivy performs a security scan on the Docker image to detect vulnerabilities in the image layers, ensuring a secure deployment.
11.Push Docker Image to Registry
The Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry (e.g., Nexus or Docker Hub), making it accessible for deployment in containerized environments like Kubernetes.
12.Update Kubernetes Manifests
Jenkins updates the Kubernetes manifest YAML files to reflect the new Docker image version or other configuration changes.
13.Deployment to Kubernetes
The updated manifests are deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. This can involve creating or updating Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, and deployments.
14.Verify Deployment
Jenkins verifies the deployment by checking the health of the deployed application in Kubernetes, ensuring it is running correctly and accessible.
15.Email Notifications
Jenkins sends email notifications to relevant stakeholders (e.g., developers, project managers) regarding the status of the deployment. This keeps everyone informed of the deployment status.

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES 
Deployment strategies in DevOps define how new versions of an application are released to users. Each strategy has its own advantages and drawbacks, and the choice of a strategy depends on factors such as the need for zero downtime, risk tolerance, rollback requirements, and complexity of the application.
1. Recreate (Single Deployment)
Description: In the recreate strategy, the existing version of the application is taken down completely, and the new version is deployed in its place. This approach causes some downtime as users cannot access the application during the deployment.
Best for: Small applications or non-critical applications where brief downtime is acceptable.
Example: A small e-commerce website can use the recreate strategy during low-traffic hours to deploy a new version. Since the downtime is short and scheduled, it minimizes disruption to users.
