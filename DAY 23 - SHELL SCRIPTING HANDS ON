1. Declaring Variables: In shell scripting, you can declare variables without specifying their data types. Variables are case-sensitive and can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or underscore. Here's how you declare a variable:
variable_name=value
2. Variable Types: Shell scripting doesn't have strict data types like other programming languages. Variables are treated as strings by default, but you can manipulate them to behave as different types.
3. Variable Assignment and Manipulation: You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator =. Here are examples of various types of variable assignments and manipulations:
# String Variable
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name!" # Output: Hello, John!
# Integer Variable
age=25
echo "Age: $age years" # Output: Age: 25 years
# Arithmetic Operations
x=10
y=5
sum=$((x + y))
echo "Sum: $sum" # Output: Sum: 15
# Concatenation
greeting="Hello"
subject="World"
message="$greeting, $subject
# String Length
string="Shell Scripting"
length=${#string}
echo "Length: $length" # Output: Length: 15
# Substring Extraction
substring=${string:0:4} # Extracts first 4 characters
echo "Substring: $substring" # Output: Substring: Shell
4. Command Substitution: You can capture the output of a command and assign it to a variable using command substitution. There are two ways to do this:
# Using Backticks
current_date=`date`
echo "Current date: $current_date"
# Using $(...)
current_time=$(date +%H:%M:%S)
echo "Current time: $current_time"
5. Readonly Variables: You can declare variables as readonly to prevent their values from being changed after initial assignment:
readonly pi=3.14159
pi=3.14 # This will result in an error
6. Unsetting Variables: You can unset (delete) a variable using the unset command:
unset variable_name
7. Quoting Variables: Quoting variables properly is essential to preserve spaces and special characters:
variable="Hello World"
echo "Using double quotes: $variable"
echo 'Using single quotes: $variable'
echo Using no quotes: $variable
echo "Using double quotes: '$variable'"
8. Escaping Characters: If you need to include special characters within a variable, you can escape them using backslashes:
special_char="\$"
echo "Variable: $special_char" # Output: Variable: $
Sure, let's delve into shell scripting with a focus on reading user input and input validation. Shell scripts are a series of commands that are executed in a sequence. User input allows scripts to interact with users and make decisions based on that input. Input validation ensures that the provided input meets certain criteria.
Reading User Input: To read user input in a shell script, you can use the read command. It reads input from the user until the Enter key is pressed and assigns the input to a variable. Here's an example:
#!/bin/bash
# Prompt the user for their name
echo "Please enter your name:"
read name
# Display a greeting using the user's input
echo "Hello, $name! Nice to meet you."
In this example, the user's input is stored in the name variable, and the script uses that input to display a greeting.
Input with Prompting: You can also use the read command with a prompt message directly, eliminating the need for separate echo commands:
#!/bin/bash
# Read input with a prompt message
read -p "Enter your favorite color: " color
echo "Your favorite color is $color."
Using read Options: The read command has various options to customize its behavior. For example:
•
-p specifies a prompt message.
•
-r disables interpreting backslashes, useful for reading file paths.
•
-t sets a timeout for input.
•
-s hides input (useful for passwords).
#!/bin/bash
# Read password without echoing characters
read -s -p "Enter your password: " password
echo "Password entered."
# Read input with timeout
read -t 5 -p "Enter something in 5 seconds: " timed_input
echo "You entered: $timed_input"
