Git Comprehensive Guide
What is Git?
Git is a Distributed Version Control System where every developer has:
•
A full copy of the repository (.git directory)
•
Complete history including all branches, commits, and tags
•
Ability to work offline, merge changes, and push to a central server
Unlike older systems (CVS, SVN), Git doesn’t rely on a central repository. It gives full power and flexibility to every contributor.
