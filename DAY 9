LINUX DIRECTORY STRUCTURE : 
/ — Root Directory 
• The base of the filesystem. Every single file and directory starts from here. 
• This is not the same as /root (which is the home directory for the root user). 
• Accessing: 
cd /

/bin — Essential User Binaries 
• Holds essential command-line tools used in single-user mode or by all users. 
• Available even when no other mount is available (e.g., during system rescue). 
• Examples of binaries: 
o ls – list directory contents 
o cp – copy files 
o mv – move/rename 
o bash – Bourne Again Shell 
• Why it matters: 
o /bin ensures that even if /usr is not mounted, basic shell functionality is 
available. 
•Path: 
ls /bin

/sbin — System Binaries 
• Contains essential system programs used by root or system administrators. 
• Not typically in a regular user’s PATH. 
• Examples: 
o shutdown, reboot – power control 
o fdisk – partitioning 
o iptables – firewall 
• These are not for everyday users. 
ls /sbin

/boot — Boot Files 
• Critical for booting the OS. 
• Contains: 
o Linux kernel – /boot/vmlinuz-* 
o Initial RAM disk – /boot/initrd.img-* 
o GRUB config – /boot/grub/grub.cfg 
• Messing with this directory can make your system unbootable. 
• Use case: 
o When upgrading the kernel 
o Troubleshooting boot issues 
ls /boot 

/dev — Device Files 
• Everything in Linux is a file—even hardware devices. 
• /dev contains special files that represent hardware devices and virtual devices. 
• Examples: 
o /dev/sda – first hard disk 
o /dev/tty – terminal 
o /dev/null – discard output 
• You can use mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt to mount a USB stick. 
• Devices are dynamically managed by udev. 
ls /dev 
ls -l /dev/null

/etc — Configuration Files 
• This is the brain of your system’s configuration. 
• Contains system-wide config files and directories. 
• Examples: 
o /etc/hostname – name of your machine 
o /etc/passwd – user account data 
o /etc/fstab – auto-mount filesystem info 
o /etc/ssh/sshd_config – SSH server config 
• Modified during system setup, service config, networking, and security. 
cat /etc/os-release 
cat /etc/hostname

/home — User Home Directories 
• Each regular user gets a subdirectory here: 
o /home/aditya 
o /home/devops_student 
• Stores user files, configs (dotfiles like .bashrc, .gitconfig), and personal projects. 
• Safe space for users to work. 
cd /home 
ls 

/lib, /lib64 — Shared Libraries 
• Contains shared libraries needed by programs in /bin and /sbin. 
• Like DLLs on Windows. 
• Examples: 
o /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 
• You can view dependencies using: 
ldd /bin/ls

/media — Mount Point for Removable Media 
• When you insert a USB drive or CD/DVD, it's automatically mounted here by GUI 
systems. 
o e.g., /media/aditya/USB_DRIVE 
• Managed by desktop environments or udisks.

/mnt — Mount Point for Temporary Mounting 
• Used by system administrators to manually mount filesystems. 
• For example: 
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt 
• Unlike /media, it’s not automatic. 

/opt — Optional Software 
• "Optional" third-party software or custom apps are installed here. 
• Example: /opt/google, /opt/vscode, /opt/tomcat 
• Keeps it separate from system packages. 

/proc — Process Information (Virtual Filesystem) 
• Virtual filesystem exposing runtime system information. 
• Dynamic files that represent system and process information. 
• Examples: 
o /proc/cpuinfo – CPU info 
o /proc/meminfo – memory info 
o /proc/[PID]/ – details of specific processes 
• Not real files on disk — virtual and constantly updating. 
cat /proc/cpuinfo 
ls /proc/$(pidof bash) 

/root — Root User’s Home Directory 
• Home directory for the root user (not /home/root!). 
• Only accessible to root. 
sudo ls /root 

/run — Temporary Runtime Files 
• Contains runtime data since boot (e.g., PIDs, sockets). 
• Replaces older /var/run and is mounted as a tmpfs (in-memory). 
• Example: /run/nginx.pid, /run/lock 
/srv — Service Data 
• "Service" directory that holds data for services provided by the system. 
• Example: Web server files 
o /srv/www or /srv/http 
o /srv/ftp for FTP files 
/sys — System Information 
• Like /proc, a virtual filesystem. 
• Exposes system and kernel information. 
• Example: /sys/class/net/ for network interfaces 

/tmp — Temporary Files 
• For temporary files created by programs. 
• Gets cleared on reboot (in most systems). 
• Example: temporary downloads, socket files. 
touch /tmp/test.txt 

/usr — User Utilities and Applications 
• Contains secondary hierarchy of files and programs not essential for boot. 
• Subdirectories: 
o /usr/bin – non-essential user commands 
o /usr/sbin – non-essential admin commands 
o /usr/lib – libraries 
o /usr/local – locally compiled apps 
/var — Variable Data 
• Contains files that grow over time. 
• Logs, spool files, databases, caches. 
• Common subdirectories: 
o /var/log/ – system logs (syslog, auth.log, dmesg) 
o /var/mail/ 
o /var/lib/ 
o /var/cache/ 
cat /var/log/syslog
