LINUX DIRECTORY STRUCTURE : 
/ — Root Directory 
• The base of the filesystem. Every single file and directory starts from here. 
• This is not the same as /root (which is the home directory for the root user). 
• Accessing: 
cd /

/bin — Essential User Binaries 
• Holds essential command-line tools used in single-user mode or by all users. 
• Available even when no other mount is available (e.g., during system rescue). 
• Examples of binaries: 
o ls – list directory contents 
o cp – copy files 
o mv – move/rename 
o bash – Bourne Again Shell 
• Why it matters: 
o /bin ensures that even if /usr is not mounted, basic shell functionality is 
available. 
•Path: 
ls /bin

/sbin — System Binaries 
• Contains essential system programs used by root or system administrators. 
• Not typically in a regular user’s PATH. 
• Examples: 
o shutdown, reboot – power control 
o fdisk – partitioning 
o iptables – firewall 
• These are not for everyday users. 
ls /sbin

/boot — Boot Files 
• Critical for booting the OS. 
• Contains: 
o Linux kernel – /boot/vmlinuz-* 
o Initial RAM disk – /boot/initrd.img-* 
o GRUB config – /boot/grub/grub.cfg 
• Messing with this directory can make your system unbootable. 
• Use case: 
o When upgrading the kernel 
o Troubleshooting boot issues 
ls /boot 

/dev — Device Files 
• Everything in Linux is a file—even hardware devices. 
• /dev contains special files that represent hardware devices and virtual devices. 
• Examples: 
o /dev/sda – first hard disk 
o /dev/tty – terminal 
o /dev/null – discard output 
• You can use mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt to mount a USB stick. 
• Devices are dynamically managed by udev. 
ls /dev 
ls -l /dev/null

/etc — Configuration Files 
• This is the brain of your system’s configuration. 
• Contains system-wide config files and directories. 
• Examples: 
o /etc/hostname – name of your machine 
o /etc/passwd – user account data 
o /etc/fstab – auto-mount filesystem info 
o /etc/ssh/sshd_config – SSH server config 
• Modified during system setup, service config, networking, and security. 
cat /etc/os-release 
cat /etc/hostname

/home — User Home Directories 
• Each regular user gets a subdirectory here: 
o /home/aditya 
o /home/devops_student 
• Stores user files, configs (dotfiles like .bashrc, .gitconfig), and personal projects. 
• Safe space for users to work. 
cd /home 
ls 

/lib, /lib64 — Shared Libraries 
• Contains shared libraries needed by programs in /bin and /sbin. 
• Like DLLs on Windows. 
• Examples: 
o /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 
• You can view dependencies using: 
ldd /bin/ls
